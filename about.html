    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm a second-year Neuroscience student with a strong background in Math and Science. I have over a year of experience working with a tutoring company, where I taught Math, English, and Programming to students from elementary to high school. I also have experience privately tutoring math to high school students. I'm passionate about helping students understand challenging concepts, build confidence, and achieve their academic goals.</p>
      <h2>About The Lesson</h2>
      <p>I try to be as interactive as possible with students, making sure they understand what I'm teaching them, and motivating them to ask questions when they're confused.</p>
      <p>A lesson will usually consist of asking if there are any urgent questions relating to the subject to start. If not, the lesson will continue with quickly reviewing a lesson, then focusing on practice problems related to the lesson. Towards the end of the lesson, I let the student answer questions on their own, so I can fix any potential problems in the student's problem solving or knowledge of the material.</p>
